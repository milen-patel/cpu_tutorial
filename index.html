        <h1>Let's Design a CPU</h1>
        <p>Ever wonder how computers work? This series, which requires no prior experience, will clearly explain how a computer works from the ground up</p>

        <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>

        <p>Let's get the whole "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br><br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.</p>


        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
